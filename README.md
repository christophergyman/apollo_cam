# Custom CCTV Framework

This is a custom CCTV framework designed for video surveillance systems using a combination of **Python**, **Golang**, **FFmpeg**, and **JavaScript**. The framework is modular and can be customized for various use cases, such as live streaming, video recording, and real-time processing of camera feeds.

## Features

- **Video Streaming**: Live video stream using FFmpeg for encoding/decoding.
- **Recording**: Capture and store video streams in different formats (e.g., MP4, MKV).
- **Motion Detection**: Real-time analysis of video feeds for motion detection (future development).
- **Multi-language support**: Backend in Python and Golang for flexibility and performance.
- **Web Interface**: A web-based interface for live viewing and controlling camera streams (using JavaScript).
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple cameras and can be extended to cloud-based storage or processing.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Used for backend video management and integration with FFmpeg.
- **Golang**: High-performance microservices for real-time data handling.
- **FFmpeg**: Video processing, transcoding, and streaming.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend for web-based control and display of video streams.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-cctv-framework.git
    cd custom-cctv-framework
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    - **Python**: Install required Python libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    - **Golang**: Install Golang dependencies:
      ```bash
      go get ./...
      ```

    - **FFmpeg**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system. You can install it via:
      - On Ubuntu/Debian:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        ```
      - On MacOS:
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```

3. **Run the system**:
    - Start the backend (Python and Golang services):
      ```bash
      python backend.py
      go run cctv-service.go
      ```
    - Open the web interface in your browser (ensure a local server is running):
      ```bash
      open http://localhost:8080
      ```

## Usage

- **Web Interface**: View and control live camera streams from the browser.
- **Recording**: Automatically record video streams and store them locally or in a cloud service.
- **Custom Development**: Modify the Python/Golang code to implement additional features like motion detection or video analytics.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Motion detection and alerts.
- [ ] Cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- [ ] Real-time face/object recognition.
